# Mailbox - A Scam Education Game
 Senior citizens are particularly vulnerable to internet scams due to limited technological literacy, cognitive impairments, and inadequate access to quality educational resources. The rise in internet usage among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic has further amplified this issue, contributing to billions of dollars lost annually and severe non-financial consequences such as emotional distress and increased mortality. To address this problem, Mailbox, a free, browser-accessible educational game, was developed to teach older adults to identify email scams.
 
 The game features realistic scam and legitimate email examples from 2024, accompanied by detailed annotations to help players learn to classify emails effectively. Accessibility was prioritized through large text, high-contrast themes, and colorblind-friendly palettes. A survey of participants aged 50+ showed an average usability score of 87.5/100 on the System Usability Scale, with players reporting increased confidence in scam identification after playing.
 
 Mailbox shows the potential of gamified education in addressing the growing issue of online scams targeting older adults. With continued development and community contributions, Mailbox can further evolve into a valuable resource for helping older adults protect themselves online.

 ### This game is open-source and is accepting contributions from the community through pull requests.
